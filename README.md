# pihole-whitelist
Simple whitelist text files that I load onto personal Pi-Hole deployments. The regex whitelist allows all apple.com and icloud.com subdomains, I tend to trust Apple's privacy practices and it breaks fewer services. The exact whitelist makes sure captive network portals will work with commonly used devices.
